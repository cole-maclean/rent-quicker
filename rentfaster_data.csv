Near bridges into the Bow River walking paths and downtown.
Open ground parking space at the back, and street parking.
The house has two main bedrooms and one bathroom with oversized shower on the main level. There is one large bedroom and bath with tub and shower downstairs, 
The upstairs has an open concept living area, dining area, and kitchen.
The downstairs is essentially a ""suite"" with fully developed large bedroom, bathroom and living/family room, (but not a separate kitchen).
There is a large storage room downstairs, and the laundry room is there.
There back yard is mainly decked, with trees and room between the deck and the parking spot. There is a small shed for storage. The backyard is fenced.
This house is not prone to flooding and did not flood in 2013 (the largest flood since 1932) unlike houses in other areas of Sunnyside.
The perfect house for a family to make their own (previous tenants parents took the downstairs bedroom and the kids took the upstairs ones). Or share the kitchen and laundry area with another couple, each having their own spaces. Otherwise a perfect house for two or three persons to live in together.
Pets are ok if they are calm and owners walk them, clean up after and they do not scratch or litter in the house.
